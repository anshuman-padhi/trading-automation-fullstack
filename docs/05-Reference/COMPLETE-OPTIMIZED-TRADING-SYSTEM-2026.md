# SECTION 1: MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
## Environment Classification & Macro Integration

### WEEKLY ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS (Every Sunday)

```
STEP 1: TREND ANALYSIS

Index Levels (Check Every Sunday):
[ ] SPY price vs 50 SMA (above/below?)
[ ] SPY price vs 200 SMA (above/below?)
[ ] QQQ price vs 50 SMA (above/below?)
[ ] QQQ price vs 200 SMA (above/below?)

Trend Classification:
✓ Both above = Strong uptrend
✗ Mixed = Weakening trend (caution)
✗ Both below = Downtrend (reduce/stop)

STEP 2: BREADTH ANALYSIS

Advance-Decline Line:
[ ] % stocks above 50-day MA
[ ] % stocks above 200-day MA
[ ] New 52-week highs vs lows ratio
[ ] Momentum divergence (price up, breadth flat?)

Breadth Score:
70%+ above both = Excellent breadth (A environment)
50-70% = Good breadth (B environment)
30-50% = Weak breadth (C environment - caution)
<30% = Deteriorating (D environment - avoid)

STEP 3: VOLATILITY ANALYSIS

VIX Level:
15-20 = Normal volatility (standard risk)
20-25 = Elevated volatility (reduce 10% sizing)
25-30 = High volatility (reduce 25% sizing)
30+ = Extreme volatility (reduce 50% sizing, minimal trading)

Position Sizing by VIX:
VIX 15-20: 100% base sizing
VIX 20-25: 90% base sizing
VIX 25-30: 75% base sizing
VIX 30+: 50% base sizing

STEP 4: MACRO CALENDAR IMPACT (NEW)

Check Economic Calendar (First thing Sunday evening):
[ ] This week's major announcements
[ ] Fed/ECB meeting (if scheduled)
[ ] Jobs report (if Friday)
[ ] Earnings season intensity (# companies reporting)
[ ] Key inflation/GDP data

Macro Impact on Sizing:

NORMAL WEEK (no major events):
- Use standard environment-based sizing
- Example: Env A = 10% base, 0.5% risk

HIGH IMPACT WEEK (1-2 major events):
- Reduce all positions 10-15%
- Reduce trade frequency 20%
- Avoid entries 1 day before major announcement
- Example: Env A = 8.5% base, 0.35% risk

EARNINGS SEASON PEAK (multiple major earnings):
- Reduce all positions 25-30%
- Avoid holding through earnings
- Example: Env A = 7% base, 0.3% risk

CRISIS/HIGH UNCERTAINTY:
- Reduce all positions 50%+
- Max 1-2 positions only
- Focus on capital preservation
- Example: Env A = 5% base, 0.25% risk

STEP 5: BREADTH DIVERGENCE CHECK (NEW)

Divergence Pattern Recognition:
If price makes new 52-week high BUT breadth diverges:
- New highs <2,000 (vs <5,000 typically) = Caution
- Advance-decline line flat/down while price up = Serious warning
- % above 50 MA declining while price up = Exit signal

Action if Divergence Detected:
- Reduce new position sizing 30-50%
- Tighten stops on existing positions 20%
- Prepare to scale out on weakness
- Exit trailing positions faster

# SECTION 4: RISK MANAGEMENT - ENHANCED
## Complete Risk Framework with Correlation Tracking

### STOP LOSS CALCULATION

```
METHOD 1: ATR-BASED STOP (Preferred)

Step 1: Calculate ATR (14-day)
Step 2: Determine Multiplier based on volatility

Tight Multiplier (1.5-2.0x ATR):
- When: Strong trend + tight setup + Env A
- Stop = Entry - (ATR × 1.5-2.0)
- Example: Entry $100, ATR $2 → Stop $97-97 (tight)

Standard Multiplier (2.0-2.5x ATR):
- When: Normal volatility + normal setup + Env B
- Stop = Entry - (ATR × 2.0-2.5)
- Example: Entry $100, ATR $2 → Stop $95-96

Wide Multiplier (2.5-3.0x ATR):
- When: Higher volatility + breakout at gap + Env C
- Stop = Entry - (ATR × 2.5-3.0)
- Example: Entry $100, ATR $2 → Stop $94-95

Very Wide Multiplier (3.0-4.0x ATR):
- When: Extreme volatility + earnings risk
- Stop = Entry - (ATR × 3.0-4.0)
- CAVEAT: Reduce position size 50% (too much risk)
- Example: Entry $100, ATR $2 → Stop $92-94

METHOD 2: TECHNICAL STOP (Secondary)

- Setup low - $0.50 (below lowest point of base)
- Below 21 EMA - 1% of price
- Below 50 SMA - 2% of price
- Below swing low - $0.25-0.50

RULE: Use the WIDER of ATR or Technical stop
(Never use the tighter stop - gives trade more room)

Example:
ATR stop: Entry $100, ATR $2, 2.5x = Stop $95 (risk $5)
Technical stop: Below 50 SMA at $92 = Stop $92 (risk $8)
Final stop: $92 (use wider technical stop)
```

### POSITION SIZING (3-STEP SYSTEM)

```
STEP 1: BASE SIZE BY ENVIRONMENT

Environment A (Strong uptrend):
- Base allocation: 10% of account per trade
- Maximum: 20% if all conditions perfect
- Risk per trade: 0.5%
- Portfolio heat limit: 2.5%
- Trade frequency: 3-5 per week

Environment B (Normal uptrend):
- Base allocation: 8% of account per trade
- Maximum: 15%
- Risk per trade: 0.4%
- Portfolio heat limit: 2.0%
- Trade frequency: 2-3 per week

Environment C (Choppy/sideways):
- Base allocation: 5% of account per trade
- Maximum: 10%
- Risk per trade: 0.25%
- Portfolio heat limit: 1.0%
- Trade frequency: 1 per week max (only A-grade)

Environment D (Downtrend):
- Base allocation: 3% of account (cash raising)
- Maximum: 5% only for shorts
- Risk per trade: 0.2%
- Portfolio heat limit: 1.5%
- Trade frequency: STOP - wait for reversal

STEP 2: EDGE ADJUSTMENT

3 edges: 50% of base (high-risk, low-edge trades)
- Env A base 10% → 5%
- Env B base 8% → 4%
- Env C base 5% → 2.5%

4 edges: 100% of base (standard trades) - No change

5 edges: 110% of base (very good trades)
- Env A base 10% → 11%

6 edges: 120% of base (excellent trades)
- Env A base 10% → 12%

7+ edges: 130% of base (highest conviction)
- Env A base 10% → 13%
- NEVER exceed maximum allocation

STEP 3: RISK-BASED VERIFICATION

Formula:
Shares = (Account Equity × Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Price)

Example:
Account: $50,000
Risk allocation: 0.5% (Env A)
Entry: $100
Stop: $95 (risk $5 per share)

Shares = ($50,000 × 0.005) / ($100 - $95)
Shares = $250 / $5
Shares = 50 shares
Position value: 50 × $100 = $5,000 = 10% of account

CROSS-CHECK:
Position size from Step 2: $5,000 (10% base, 4 edges)
Position size from Step 3: $5,000 (0.5% risk formula)
✓ Both match - trade approved

If they don't match: USE SMALLER POSITION SIZE
(Never let position exceed risk formula)

MAXIMUM SINGLE TRADE: Portfolio Heat × 0.3
(Never more than 30% of total heat in one trade)
```

### NEW: PORTFOLIO CORRELATION TRACKING

```
POSITION CORRELATION MATRIX (Monthly Review)

Track all open positions and their correlation:

Position 1: NVDA (Tech)
Position 2: TSLA (Tech)
Position 3: MSFT (Tech)
Position 4: AMD (Tech)
Position 5: XLF (Finance)
Position 6: XLK (Software/Tech)

Correlation Analysis:
- NVDA vs TSLA: 0.85 (highly correlated - RISK)
- NVDA vs AMD: 0.72 (correlated - caution)
- NVDA vs XLF: 0.15 (uncorrelated - GOOD)
- Tech cluster correlation: 0.78 (reduce Tech)
- Finance vs Tech: 0.20 (diversified - GOOD)

ACTION:
High correlation (>0.70): Add position in uncorrelated sector
Very high correlation (>0.80): Close smallest position, reduce heat

Correlation Score Calculation:
Average portfolio correlation:
- <0.40: Well diversified (ideal)
- 0.40-0.50: Good diversification
- 0.50-0.60: Acceptable diversification
- 0.60-0.70: Concentration risk (add different sector)
- >0.70: Over-concentrated (must rebalance)

IF correlation >0.70 of portfolio:
- Add new position in different sector
- Reduce sizing on highly correlated positions
- Example: If 70% Tech, max 10% sizing on new Tech trade
```

### PORTFOLIO HEAT LIMITS (Refined)

```
PORTFOLIO HEAT = Sum of all stop distances on open positions

Example Portfolio:
Position 1: Risk $250 (2.5 heat)
Position 2: Risk $300 (3.0 heat)
Position 3: Risk $200 (2.0 heat)
Position 4: Risk $250 (2.5 heat)
Position 5: Risk $150 (1.5 heat)

Total Portfolio Heat: 12.5 units (0.5 × $50,000 account)

HEAT LIMITS BY ENVIRONMENT:

Environment A: Maximum 2.5% heat (typically 5 positions)
Environment B: Maximum 2.0% heat (typically 3-4 positions)
Environment C: Maximum 1.0% heat (typically 1-2 positions)
Environment D: Maximum 0.3% heat (hold cash, minimal positions)

IF heat exceeds limit:
1. STOP entering new positions immediately
2. Take profits on winners (Stage 1 sales)
3. Do not add to positions
4. Wait for heat to decline or close positions

RULE: Never intentionally breach heat limits
- It's the CIRCUIT BREAKER safety mechanism
- Protects account from catastrophic loss
- Discipline is the only edge in trading
```

### CIRCUIT BREAKERS (Mandatory)

```
CIRCUIT BREAKER LEVEL 1: -5% DRAWDOWN

Trigger: Account down 5% from peak
Action:
[ ] Stop all new position entries
[ ] Tighten stops 50% closer (reduce risk by half)
[ ] Reassess environment (any changes?)
[ ] Reduce position sizing 20%
[ ] Duration: Minimum 3 trading days

Example:
Peak equity: $50,000
Trigger: -$2,500 = $47,500
Sizing: Reduce from 10% to 8% (Env A)
Risk reduction: 0.5% → 0.35% per trade

CIRCUIT BREAKER LEVEL 2: -10% DRAWDOWN

Trigger: Account down 10% from peak
Action:
[ ] Close 50% of all open positions (at market)
[ ] Move remaining positions to breakeven stops (hard)
[ ] Cancel all pending orders
[ ] Close trading platform for 1 week
[ ] No new trades until environment stabilizes

Example:
Peak equity: $50,000
Trigger: -$5,000 = $45,000
Action: Sell 50% of positions immediately

CIRCUIT BREAKER LEVEL 3: -15% DRAWDOWN

Trigger: Account down 15% from peak
Action:
[ ] Close ALL positions (100%, immediately)
[ ] Stop trading for 30 days (MANDATORY)
[ ] Complete system audit (what went wrong?)
[ ] Rebuild confidence through paper trading
[ ] Only resume if identified issue + fixed it

Example:
Peak equity: $50,000
Trigger: -$7,500 = $42,500
Action: Close everything, stop completely 30 days

SEVERE CIRCUIT BREAKER: -25% DRAWDOWN

If account drops 25%:
[ ] Close all positions
[ ] Take 90-day break (minimum)
[ ] Serious reevaluation of strategy
[ ] Consider if trading is for you
[ ] Need 100+ new paper trades to rebuild confidence

CIRCUIT BREAKER DISCIPLINE:
✗ NEVER ignore circuit breakers
✗ NEVER try to "make it back" immediately after
✗ NEVER trade larger after hitting breaker
✓ ALWAYS respect the protocols (they save accounts)
```

# SECTION 5: SELL RULES & EXIT STRATEGY - ENHANCED
## 3-Stage Profit Taking + Scale-Out Rules

### 3-STAGE PROFIT-TAKING SYSTEM

```
STAGE 1 PROFIT-TAKING: +10% Gain

When stock gains +10% from entry:
[ ] Sell exactly 33% of position (1/3)
[ ] Lock in profit: 3.3% of total account
[ ] Move stop to breakeven on remaining 67%
[ ] Set alert at +20% for Stage 2

Calculation example:
Entry: $100, position 300 shares = $30,000 (60% of account)
+10% = $110
Sell: 100 shares at $110 = $11,000 profit
Remaining: 200 shares
New stop: Entry price $100 (breakeven)
Risk on remaining: $0 (already won!)

STAGE 2 PROFIT-TAKING: +20% Gain

When stock gains +20% from entry:
[ ] Sell another 33% (1/3 of original position)
[ ] Total profit locked: 6.6% of account
[ ] Move stop to entry + 10% ($110)
[ ] Trail remaining 33% with 21 EMA or ATR

Calculation example (continuing above):
Entry: $100, remaining 200 shares after Stage 1
+20% = $120
Sell: 100 more shares at $120 = $10,000 profit
Remaining: 100 shares (1/3 of original)
New stop: $110 (entry $100 + 10% profit)
Total profit locked: $21,000 (42% return on core 50%)

STAGE 3: TRAIL RUNNER (Capture the big move)

Remaining 33% of position (1/3 original):
[ ] Trail stop with 21 EMA (updated daily)
OR
[ ] Trail stop with ATR × 2.5 (tightens with profit growth)
[ ] Adjust stop daily when price makes new high
[ ] Exit on stop hit or weakness signal

Calculation example (continuing above):
Remaining: 100 shares
Entry: $100, Current: $120
Trail stops:
- 21 EMA: Currently $118 (so stop at $118)
- ATR stop: $115 (if ATR $2, 2.5x = $120-5=$115)
- Use WIDER: $118 (21 EMA)

If stock rises to $130:
- 21 EMA probably around $125
- Move stop to $125
- Still holding for more upside

If stock drops below $118:
- Exit entire remaining position
- Locked in ~$32,000 profit total
```

### WEAKNESS EXIT SIGNALS (Immediate Exits)

```
SIGNAL 1: Close below 21 EMA on volume
Condition:
- Stock closes below 21 EMA
- Volume is 1.5x+ average
- Momentum has clearly shifted negative

Action: EXIT entire remaining position immediately

Rationale: This is THE most reliable exit signal
- 21 EMA represents short-term trend
- Close below on volume = trend broken
- Holding for "one more day" usually costs money

SIGNAL 2: Break below 50 SMA
Condition:
- Intraday or close below 50 SMA
- 50 SMA was key support
- Position gains still significant

Action: TIGHTEN stop, don't exit yet
- Move stop from entry +10% to breakeven
- Or close 50% of position immediately
- Watch for re-entry opportunity on bounce

SIGNAL 3: Lower high after higher high
Condition:
- New high formed (e.g., $130)
- Next high is lower (e.g., $128)
- Pattern shows trend weakening

Action: TIGHTEN stop
- Move stop to previous swing low + $0.50
- This protects against reversal
- Watch for double top (exit signal)

SIGNAL 4: Volume drying up on gains
Condition:
- Stock up but on decreasing volume
- Volume trend: down day to day
- Momentum running out of fuel

Action: TIGHTEN stop or BEGIN SCALE OUT
- Reduce position 25-50% immediately
- Move remaining stop closer
- This often precedes reversal

SIGNAL 5: Failed bounce on weak volume
Condition:
- Stock pulled back from high
- Tried to bounce back up
- Bounce failed on weak volume

Action: TIGHTEN stop immediately
- Move stop to recent low + $0.50
- This is often a breakdown signal
- Ready to exit on weakness

KEY RULE: Don't ignore these signals
- Most traders do → they're why they lose money
- You'll follow them → you'll be in top 5%
- Test in paper trading: follow signal = win, ignore = loss
```

### NEW: CORE POSITION SCALE-OUT RULES (>30% gains)

```
When position is up >30% (exceptional performers):

Scale-Out Strategy:
Instead of holding forever, lock in gains in tiers

At +30%:
[ ] Sell 50% of remaining core position
[ ] Lock in 30% × 50% = 15% gain
[ ] Move stop to entry + 15% profit
[ ] Trail final 50% of core

At +50%:
[ ] Sell 50% of what's left
[ ] Realize 50% × 25% = 12.5% additional gain
[ ] Total locked: 27.5% (massive)
[ ] Trail final 25% with wide 3x ATR stop

At +100%:
[ ] Sell all remaining if position has lasted 60+ days
[ ] Never let triple-digit gainer become breaker
[ ] "A bird in hand is worth two in bush"
[ ] Lock it in, move to next trade

Position lifetime management:
- Entry to +20%: 2-5 days typical
- +20% to +50%: 5-20 days typical
- +50%+: Hold max 30-60 days
- Never hold winner >90 days (capital could be better used)

Example: NVDA spike from $100 to $200+
Entry: $100, 100 shares = $10,000
+30% = $130: Sell 50% (50 shares) = $6,500 profit, keep 50 shares
+50% = $150: Sell 50% of remaining (25 shares) = $3,750 profit, keep 25 shares
+100% = $200: Sell all remaining (25 shares) = $5,000 profit
Total profit: $15,250 on $10,000 entry (152% return)
```

### EARNINGS MANAGEMENT

```
EARNINGS PERIOD: 1 week before announcement

Action:
[ ] Exit 50% of position 1 week before earnings
[ ] Do NOT hold through surprise earnings
[ ] Reason: Binary event, unpredictable volatility

Example:
TSLA announces earnings Jan 20
Jan 13 morning: Sell 50% of position
Jan 14-20: Hold only 50% of position
Jan 20 after close: Exit all remaining before report

EARNINGS PERIOD: 3 days before announcement

Action:
[ ] Exit remaining position completely
[ ] Do not hold overnight for earnings
[ ] Reason: Gap risk if negative surprise

Example (continuing):
Jan 17 afternoon: Sell final 50%
Jan 18-20: No TSLA position
Jan 20: Earnings announced, no exposure

RULE: Never hold unprepared through earnings
- Even if you "expect a beat"
- Even if analyst consensus is positive
- One bad number and position gapped against you
- Not worth it - next trade will be better

EXCEPTION: If you have hedge (covered call sold)
- Acceptable to hold through earnings
- Covered call already locks in max gain
- Assignment possible = capital tied up anyway
```

### TIME-BASED EXITS

```
TIME-BASED EXIT #1: 10 days flat (no progress)
If stock makes no new high for 10 days:
[ ] Exit 50% of position
[ ] Move stop to breakeven on remainder
[ ] Capital not working efficiently
- Better to reallocate to moving stocks

TIME-BASED EXIT #2: 20 days without new high
If stock reaches 20 days with no new high:
[ ] Exit entire position
[ ] Recognize setup has failed
- 20 days = market decided trade is done
- Move money to next setup

TIME-BASED EXIT #3: 30 days from entry (swing trade exit)
If in swing trade (not holding long-term):
[ ] Exit entire position at market
[ ] Swing trades have natural 3-4 week life
- After 30 days, position has mean-reverted
- Time decay working against you
- Move to next trade

EXAMPLE TIMELINE:
Day 1: Entry $100, up to $105
Day 3: Up to $112
Day 5: Up to $115 (new high)
Day 10: Still at $115-116 range
Action: Exit 50% (10 days no new high)
Day 15: Up to $120 (new high - glad we kept 50%!)
Day 22: Down to $118
Action: Exit remaining (20 days, no new high past $120)

TIME DISCIPLINE:
- These rules remove emotion
- They prevent "hope holding"
- They free capital for next trade
- They improve win rate by forcing exits
```

# SECTION 7: CONTINGENCY PLANNING - ENHANCED
## 17 Disaster Protocols + Recovery Procedures

### MARKET CRASH PROTOCOLS

```
MARKET CRASH LEVEL 1: Market down -5%

Triggers:
- S&P 500 down 5% from yesterday close
- VIX spike >25 (if was <20)
- Broad market decline across all sectors

Immediate Actions:

[ ] Prepare for "Level 2" if market continues down

Portfolio adjustments:
- Reduce new position sizing 20%
- Raise entry criteria to Grade A only (8+ edges minimum)
- Move stops on all positions 50% of original distance

Duration: Minimum 3 trading days
- After 3 days, if market stabilized → resume normal

[ ] Hard stops at breakeven on remaining 50%
[ ] Cancel ALL pending/working orders
[ ] Do NOT enter any new positions
[ ] Move to 100% cash if personal account down >5% today
[ ] Contact broker (verify account is intact)
[ ] Document all positions and prices

Portfolio adjustments:
- Close half of every position
- Example: 4 positions → close 2, hold 2 (with tight stops)
- Remaining positions: Stops at breakeven (no profit allowed)
- Ready for Level 3 if market falls further

Duration: Stop trading for 1 WEEK
- After 1 week if market recovered >5% → resume cautiously
- If market still crashing → Level 3

MARKET CRASH LEVEL 3: Market down -15%+ or Circuit Breaker Halt

Triggers:
- S&P 500 down 15%+ from peak
- VIX >40+
- Stock exchanges halt trading (circuit breaker halt)
- Market clearly broken/panicking

Immediate Actions:
[ ] Close ALL positions 100% (do not hesitate)
[ ] Exit immediately at market price (best available bid)
[ ] Move to 100% CASH (no exceptions)
[ ] Stop trading for minimum 30 DAYS (firm commitment)
[ ] DO NOT try to "pick bottom"
[ ] Secure emergency fund (6 months expenses still intact?)

Psychological actions:
[ ] Call a trusted family member or friend (talk through panic)
[ ] Do NOT make big decisions in panic mode
[ ] Take 5-day break (clear your head)
[ ] After 5 days: Review what happened (learn lesson)
[ ] After 30 days: Paper trade 50 trades before resuming live

Preparedness drill:
[ ] Review this protocol monthly
[ ] Imagine scenario and walk through steps
[ ] Know broker's phone number (have it saved)
[ ] Know backup platform (have login ready)
[ ] Have emergency fund separated (don't touch it)
```

### PERSONAL & TECHNICAL DISASTERS

```
PERSONAL DISASTER #1: Family Emergency

If you need to step away from trading:
[ ] Close all open positions IMMEDIATELY
[ ] Move proceeds to cash/money market
[ ] Stop trading until situation resolved
[ ] Set alert on account (if computer access unavailable)
[ ] Give trusted family member broker password (only in emergency)

PERSONAL DISASTER #2: Internet Outage

Prevention:
[ ] Have mobile hotspot backup (tether phone to computer)
[ ] Have broker mobile app installed and tested monthly
[ ] Have backup broker contact number in your phone

If internet goes out mid-trading:
[ ] Switch to mobile hotspot immediately
[ ] Check account on mobile app
[ ] Are positions still held? Are stops active?
[ ] If cannot reconnect in 15 minutes → call broker
[ ] Broker can execute emergency orders by phone

TECHNICAL DISASTER #3: Broker Platform Crash

Prevention:
[ ] Know backup platform URL
[ ] Have mobile app alternative ready
[ ] Test mobile app quarterly

If main platform goes down:
[ ] Switch to mobile app immediately
[ ] Place orders using mobile app
[ ] Contact broker support (have their number saved)
[ ] Know that broker's backup systems usually working
[ ] Stops should still be active (held on broker server)

TECHNICAL DISASTER #4: Computer Crash

Prevention:
[ ] Cloud backup of all files (Google Drive, Dropbox)
[ ] Position list saved in cloud (checked daily)
[ ] Trader journal backed up (automatic sync)

If computer crashes mid-trading:
[ ] Grab phone immediately (use mobile app)
[ ] Check account via mobile (positions still there?)
[ ] All stops should still be active
[ ] Don't panic - your money is at broker (not on computer)
[ ] Use mobile app to manage for rest of day
[ ] Replace computer tonight/tomorrow
```

### ACCOUNT DISASTERS & RECOVERY

```
ACCOUNT DISASTER #1: -15% Drawdown from Peak

Protocol:
[ ] Circuit Breaker Level 1 triggered (automatic)
[ ] Stop trading for 30 days (firm)
[ ] Audit: What went wrong?
  - Position sizing too large?
  - Edges inadequate (entering at 3 edges instead of 4)?
  - Stops too loose?
  - Circuit breaker violated?
[ ] Paper trade 30+ positions (validate fix)
[ ] If issue identified and fixed → resume live
[ ] If issue not clear → stay in paper longer

Recovery Plan:
Week 1: Complete system audit
Week 2-3: Paper trade 30+ positions
Week 4: Live resume at 50% sizing
Week 5-6: If profitable on half size → increase to 75%
Week 7-8: If still profitable → resume full size

ACCOUNT DISASTER #2: -25% Drawdown from Peak

Protocol:
[ ] STOP all trading for 90 days (mandatory)
[ ] This is serious - your system has major flaw(s)
[ ] Complete forensic audit of all trades
[ ] Identify: Which rule(s) were broken?
[ ] Paper trade 100+ positions with fixed system
[ ] Only resume if:
   a) Issue clearly identified
   b) Fixed in paper trading 100+ times
   c) Personal confidence restored

Questions to ask yourself:
- Did I violate position sizing? (most common)
- Did I enter below 4 edges? (too many losers)
- Did I ignore circuit breakers? (catastrophic)
- Did I revenge trade? (emotional decision)
- Did I hold through earnings unprepared? (volatility)

If answers show systemic issues:
- Recommit to rules 100%
- Paper trade minimum 100 positions
- Reduce live sizing by 50% for first month
- Only resume full size after 60-day profitable period

ACCOUNT DISASTER #3: Margin Call / Forced Liquidation

Prevention (most important):
[ ] NEVER use margin (don't borrow)
[ ] Only trade with capital you own
[ ] Keep 30%+ cash buffer (cushion for drawdowns)
[ ] Set personal drawdown limit at -15% (never let reach margin)

If margin call occurs anyway:
[ ] Broker will force-close positions (usually biggest losers)
[ ] You lose all control of timing
[ ] Fees + penalties applied
[ ] Account marked (possible restrictions)

Recovery:
[ ] Deposit cash immediately to restore account
[ ] Stop trading for 60 days
[ ] Switch to 100% cash account (never margin again)
[ ] Reevaluate: Can you afford to lose 25% of account?
  - If YES → continue trading (it can happen)
  - If NO → reduce account size or stop trading
```

### PSYCHOLOGICAL DISASTERS & SOLUTIONS

```
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISASTER #1: Emotional Tilt

Signs:
- Making trades on "gut feel" (not following checklist)
- Breaking size rules (trading too large)
- Revenge trading (trying to make back losses immediately)
- Ignoring stops (hoping position comes back)

Immediate Solution:
[ ] Close all positions (right now)
[ ] Take 3-day break (no trading, no watching)
[ ] During break: review journal of mistakes
[ ] After 3 days: paper trade 20+ positions to rebuild confidence
[ ] Resume live with 50% sizing

Prevention:
- Journal every trade (see emotional patterns)
- Acknowledge: Some days you'll feel tilt coming
- Have "tilt protocol": Close all, take break, reflect
- Use pre-trade checklist religiously (slows down decisions)

PSYCHOLOGICAL DISASTER #2: Overconfidence After Big Win

Signs:
- Increasing position sizes after winning
- Entering trades with <4 edges ("I'm hot now!")
- Ignoring checklist (skip steps)
- Taking larger risks than planned

Immediate Solution:
[ ] After 3 winning trades: Reduce sizing 20% for 5 trades
[ ] Recommit to checklist (every single trade)
[ ] Intentionally skip 2 setups (discipline exercise)
[ ] No new position sizing increases for 30 days

Prevention:
- Know that wins often precede losses (regression to mean)
- Big winners can turn into big losers fast
- Stick to system regardless of recent success
- Success comes from consistent execution, not hot streaks

PSYCHOLOGICAL DISASTER #3: Despair After Big Loss

Signs:
- Feeling defeated ("Maybe I can't do this")
- Skipping trades (lack of confidence)
- Overanalyzing every trade (paralysis analysis)
- Questioning entire system

Immediate Solution:
[ ] Take 5-day break (clear your head)
[ ] Do NOT make major decisions while emotional
[ ] After break: Start paper trading again
[ ] Set small goal: Win 3 paper trades in a row
[ ] Once confidence restored: Resume live slowly

Prevention:
- Understand: Losing streaks are NORMAL
- 50% win rate means 50% losses too
- System is good = some losses are expected
- Big loss just means probabilities will favor wins next

PSYCHOLOGICAL DISASTER #4: Revenge Trading

Definition: Trying to quickly make back a big loss through aggressive trades

Signs:
- Making entries with <4 edges (normally require 4+)
- Increasing position sizes (normally 10%, now 15%+)
- Ignoring checklist scores (entering at 70 instead of 80+)
- Taking excessive risks

Immediate Solution:
[ ] STOP (this is critical moment)
[ ] Close all positions
[ ] Take 2-day break (mandatory)
[ ] Journal: What just happened? What triggered revenge trading?
[ ] Resume with half sizing for 5 trades

Prevention:
- Circuit breaker rule: 3 losses in a row = stop 2 days
- After -10% drawdown: reduce sizing for 1 week
- Rules exist to prevent revenge trading
- Discipline is your edge, emotion is your enemy
```

### QUARTERLY DISASTER DRILL

```
QUARTERLY DISASTER PREPAREDNESS DRILL:

Every 3 months (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct), spend 30 minutes on drill:

Drill 1: Market Crash Simulation
- Imagine S&P 500 down 15% today
- Walk through Level 3 protocol step-by-step
- Close all positions mentally
- Review cash position (have 30%+ available?)
- Call broker (practice emergency procedures)
- Duration: 20 minutes

Drill 2: Internet Outage Simulation
- Turn off internet on computer (force outage)
- Pick up phone, open broker mobile app
- Can you see account? All positions visible?
- Can you place order on mobile app?
- Duration: 10 minutes

Drill 3: Emotional Tilt Check
- Review last month's trades
- Did you follow 100% of rules? YES/NO
- Any rule-breaking trades? If yes, why?
- Commit to 100% rule compliance next month
- Duration: 10 minutes

QUARTERLY EVALUATION:
Disaster Preparedness Score: ___/100

100 = Perfect (all protocols understood, tested, ready)
80-100 = Excellent (ready for any crisis)
60-80 = Good (mostly prepared)
40-60 = Fair (need to review protocols)
<40 = Poor (urgent: study contingency section)

If score <80: Spend 2 hours reviewing all protocols
If score 80+: Good - maintain preparedness

# SECTION 9: CAPITAL MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS PLANNING
## Enhanced 1-3 Year Roadmap with Capital Triggers

### CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ROADMAP

```
CAPITAL ADD/REDUCTION TRIGGERS:

TRIGGER 1: When to Add Capital (Expand)

Add capital when:
✓ 6+ months of profitable trading documented
✓ Win rate >55% sustained
✓ Profit factor >1.75x sustained
✓ 0 circuit breaker violations
✓ <20% max drawdown
✓ Discipline score 95%+
✓ Family/spouse agreement (if joint)

Add capital in TRANCHES (not all at once):
Month 1: Add 25% more capital
Month 2-3: If still profitable → add another 25%
Month 4-6: Only after 6+ months success → add final 50%

Example timeline:
Starting capital: $50,000
Month 6 (profitable): Add $12,500 → Total $62,500
Month 9 (still profitable): Add $12,500 → Total $75,000
Month 12 (6+ months success): Add $25,000 → Total $100,000

Maximum capital to manage alone: $100-250k
(Beyond this: requires additional discipline/time/risk management)

TRIGGER 2: When to Reduce Capital (Defensive)

Reduce capital when:
✗ Win rate drops below 45% (not profitable)
✗ Profit factor drops below 1.3x
✗ <10% monthly return (system might be deteriorating)
✗ Hit 2 circuit breakers in same quarter
✗ Any major rule violation patterns

Reduction strategy:
- Reduce new position sizing 20-30%
- Increase cash buffer to 50%
- Stop taking new positions
- Focus on capital preservation
- Paper trade 50+ positions to validate fix
- Only resume growth after fix confirmed

CAPITAL PRESERVATION RULE:
Once you've made 50%+ return: Withdraw 25-50% of gains
- Locks in profit (can't lose what you withdrew)
- Reduces pressure on remaining capital
- Psychological benefit: "Bank the win"

Example:
Starting: $50,000
After year 1 (successful): $75,000 (+50%)
Withdraw: $12,500 of gains
Keep: $62,500 (still up 25%)
New floor: $62,500 (can't fall below this)

LEVERAGE GUIDELINES:
Avoid leverage at all costs:
✗ Never use margin (trading with borrowed money)
✗ Never short stocks (additional complexity)
✗ Never use options until experienced (separate system)
✗ Never use leveraged ETFs for core trading

Reason: Leverage = 2x losses when system fails
         Most traders' first loss in leverage = game over
```
