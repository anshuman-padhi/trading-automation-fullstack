## PART 1: YOUR HIGH-POTENTIAL STOCK DEFINITION

### The Foundation: What You're Looking For

**General Definition** (starting point):
> "A high-potential stock is a stock that has shown a display of power and strength, and has now set up in a repeatable pattern that offers an asymmetric reward-to-risk opportunity."

**Customized for YOUR style** (growth/momentum swing trading):

```
MY HIGH-POTENTIAL STOCK DEFINITION v1.0

A high-potential stock for my swing trading system (5-20 day holds) must demonstrate:

1. RECENT POWER & STRENGTH (Technical Proof)
   ✓ Strong relative strength: RS rating >85 (top quartile)
   ✓ Recent sharp upside move: +20% in last 4-8 weeks OR making new 52-week highs
   ✓ Trading above key moving averages: 
     - Price > 10 SMA > 21 EMA > 50 SMA (aligned uptrend)
   ✓ Volume profile: Expanding on up days, contracting on pullbacks
   ✓ Clean price action: Respects moving averages, doesn't whipsaw

2. CHARACTER OF A LEADER (Historical Proof)
   ✓ Proven trendability: Previous bases led to 30%+ moves
   ✓ Trends cleanly above 21 EMA when in motion
   ✓ Respects support at key levels (21 EMA, 50 SMA, prior pivots)
   ✓ Part of a leading sector/theme (not random individual strength)
   ✓ Institutional quality: Average daily volume >$5M, liquid

3. ACTIONABLE SETUP PRESENT (Entry Opportunity)
   ✓ Clear, low-risk setup forming:
     - Base breakout (20-40 day consolidation)
     - Pullback to 21 EMA (above 50 SMA)
     - Tight flag after strong move
   ✓ Entry point with defined stop (2-4% risk maximum for swings)
   ✓ Risk/reward at least 2:1 (minimum 8-10% potential vs 4% risk)
   ✓ Volume pattern confirms setup (contraction in base, expansion on breakout)

4. FUNDAMENTAL/GROWTH QUALITY (Earnings Support)
   ✓ YoY earnings growth >40% (OR >20% for mega-cap with acceleration)
   ✓ Sales growth accelerating (current Q > previous Q)
   ✓ Analyst estimates rising (positive revisions last 30 days)
   ✓ Upcoming catalyst visible (earnings in 2-4 weeks, product launch, etc.)
   ✓ No major red flags (fraud, regulatory issues, competitive threats)

5. THEME/NARRATIVE STRENGTH (Market Context)
   ✓ Part of 2025-2026 leading theme:
     - AI / Large Language Models (NVDA, MSFT, META)
     - Semiconductors (NVDA, AMD, ASML, SMCI)
     - Cybersecurity (CRWD, PALO, OKTA, ZS, NET)
     - Cloud infrastructure (MSFT, GOOGL, data/storage)
     - Robotics/Automation (emerging themes)
   ✓ Multiple stocks in same theme performing well (confirmation)
   ✓ Sector ETF making new highs or showing strength
   ✓ >50% of sector above 50-day SMA (sector health)

MY RULE FOR TRADE APPROVAL:
- Minimum 4 of 5 categories must be checked (at least 80%)
- Prefer 5 of 5 for full-sized positions (10-20% of portfolio)
- May accept 3 of 5 for smaller starter positions (5% max)
- 2 or fewer = pass, not worth the risk

EXAMPLE APPLICATION:

Stock: NVIDIA (NVDA) - December 2024
1. Recent power: ✓ (RS 98, +35% last 6 weeks, above all MAs)
2. Character: ✓ (Proven 30%+ mover, clean trends, respects 21 EMA)
3. Setup: ✓ (20-day base breakout forming at $138)
4. Growth: ✓ (Data center revenue +150% YoY, AI chip demand)
5. Theme: ✓ (AI/semiconductors leading theme, multiple semis working)

Score: 5/5 ✓ APPROVED for 10-20% position (depending on environment)

---

Stock: Random Small-Cap Tech
1. Recent power: ✓ (RS 88, +25% last 4 weeks)
2. Character: ✗ (No history, IPO 6 months ago, choppy action)
3. Setup: ✓ (Pullback to 21 EMA visible)
4. Growth: ? (Limited data, 1 quarter reported)
5. Theme: ✗ (Not part of clear theme, standalone)

Score: 2/5 ✗ PASS - not enough confirmation
```

## PART 2: T.I.G.E.R.S FRAMEWORK APPLIED TO YOUR UNIVERSE

### What T.I.G.E.R.S Means for You

The T.I.G.E.R.S framework ensures stocks aren't just "technically looking good" - they have multiple layers of strength.

**Your Customized T.I.G.E.R.S Criteria:**

```
T - THEME (Leading Sector/Narrative)

MY LEADING THEMES FOR 2025-2026:

Primary Themes (60% of watchlist should come from these):
✓ AI / Large Language Models
  - Key stocks: NVDA, MSFT, META, GOOGL, AMZN
  - Why: AI infrastructure buildout, enterprise adoption accelerating
  - ETF proxy: XLK, SOXX, SMH

✓ Semiconductors (AI Chips, Design, Manufacturing)
  - Key stocks: NVDA, AMD, ASML, SMCI, AVGO, LRCX
  - Why: Semiconductor super-cycle driven by AI, automotive, data centers
  - ETF proxy: SOXX, SMH

✓ Cybersecurity
  - Key stocks: CRWD, PALO, OKTA, ZS, NET, S, PANW
  - Why: Rising cyber threats, zero-trust adoption, cloud migration
  - ETF proxy: CIBR, HACK

✓ Cloud Infrastructure / SaaS
  - Key stocks: MSFT, GOOGL, CRM, NOW, DDOG, SNOW, NET
  - Why: Digital transformation, cloud migration ongoing
  - ETF proxy: CLOU, WCL

Secondary Themes (20% of watchlist, emerging):
✓ Robotics / Automation
  - Key stocks: TMDX (emerging), automation plays
  - Why: Labor shortages, manufacturing automation
  
✓ Electric Vehicles / Battery Tech
  - Key stocks: TSLA (leader), battery/charging infrastructure
  - Why: EV adoption curve, regulatory tailwinds

✓ Fintech / Payments
  - Key stocks: SQ, PYPL, COIN (crypto), V, MA
  - Why: Digital payments, blockchain adoption

Other Themes (20% opportunistic):
✓ Healthcare Tech / Biotech (if setup meets criteria)
✓ E-commerce / Consumer Tech (AMZN, SHOP, etc.)
✓ Energy (only if showing leadership during rallies)

MY THEME RULE:
"At least 70% of my Universe List must come from Primary Themes.
I will not hold more than 3 stocks from same exact sub-theme 
(e.g., max 3 AI semiconductor names simultaneously to avoid concentration)."

---

I - INNOVATION (Unique Product/Competitive Moat)

Company must have clear differentiation:
✓ Unique product or service that separates from peers
✓ Technology leadership (not "me too" player)
✓ Network effects, switching costs, or IP moat
✓ First-mover advantage in emerging category

Examples that qualify:
- NVDA: GPU architecture dominance, CUDA ecosystem lock-in
- META: Llama AI models, massive user base network effects
- CRWD: AI-powered threat detection, single-agent architecture
- ASML: Only company making EUV lithography machines (monopoly)

Examples that DON'T qualify:
- Generic software resellers with no differentiation
- Commodity hardware manufacturers
- "Also-ran" cloud providers competing with AWS/Azure/GCP
- Me-too AI companies with no unique angle

MY RULE:
"Stock must have clear, defensible innovation edge. 
I should be able to explain in 1-2 sentences why this company 
is unique and hard to displace. If I can't, it doesn't qualify."

---

G - GROWTH (Earnings & Sales Acceleration)

Required metrics for MY swing trading system:

Earnings Growth:
✓ Current quarter YoY EPS growth: >40% (or >20% for mega-caps with acceleration)
✓ Next quarter expected growth: Similar or higher (no deceleration)
✓ Growth trend: Accelerating preferred (Q2 > Q1 > Q4 prior year)

Sales Growth:
✓ Current quarter YoY revenue growth: >20%
✓ Sales growth accelerating (not decelerating)

Analyst Sentiment:
✓ EPS estimate revisions: Positive last 30 days (upward revisions)
✓ Price target increases: At least 2-3 analysts raising targets
✓ Guidance: Company raised guidance in last earnings report (preferred)

Where to find this data:
- TradingView: Earnings tab (real-time)
- Finviz: Fundamental tab (quarterly data)
- MarketWatch: Earnings section
- Seeking Alpha: Earnings transcripts

MY GROWTH THRESHOLDS:

Mega-caps (>$500B market cap):
- Acceptable: 20%+ YoY EPS, 15%+ revenue
- Example: MSFT 25% EPS growth, 18% revenue = ✓

Large-caps ($100B-500B):
- Target: 30%+ YoY EPS, 20%+ revenue
- Example: NVDA 150% EPS growth, 120% revenue = ✓✓✓

Mid-caps ($10B-100B):
- Target: 40%+ YoY EPS, 25%+ revenue
- Example: CRWD 50% EPS growth, 35% revenue = ✓

Small-caps (<$10B):
- Target: 50%+ YoY EPS (high growth compensates for risk)
- May accept negative EPS if revenue growth >100% (early stage)

MY RULE:
"I require strong growth (>40% EPS or >20% sales) with acceleration.
If growth is decelerating (current Q < previous Q), I will downgrade 
the stock in my watchlist and require 2x other edges to compensate."

---

E - EDGES (Technical Chart Characteristics)

The chart must show one or more of MY defined technical edges:

Edge #1: RS Phase Strength
✓ RS line (stock vs SPY) above rising 21 EMA
✓ RS rating >85 (top 15% of market)
✓ Making new relative highs vs market

Edge #2: Volume Profile
✓ Highest volume in 52 weeks during last quarter (HV edge)
✓ 20-day average volume increased 25%+ last 2 months
✓ Volume expanding on up days, contracting on pullbacks

Edge #3: Base Structure Quality
✓ Clean bases (20-40 day consolidations with <10% depth)
✓ Volume contracts in base (shows tight supply)
✓ Breakouts on 50-100%+ volume expansion

Edge #4: Multi-Timeframe Alignment
✓ Daily chart: Price > 21 EMA, uptrend intact
✓ Weekly chart: Price > 50 SMA, uptrend intact
✓ Both timeframes confirming strength

Edge #5: Trendability (Historical Performance)
✓ Previous bases led to 30%+ moves (proven winner)
✓ Trended cleanly above 21 EMA during last move
✓ Didn't whipsaw or break moving averages randomly

MY RULE:
"Stock should have 2-3 technical edges minimum.
For full-sized positions (10-20%), I prefer 3+ edges.
Edges are my quantitative proof the stock is technically superior."

---

R - RELATIVE STRENGTH (Outperforming Market & Peers)

RS must be demonstrated on multiple timeframes:

1-Month RS:
✓ RS rating >85 (outperforming 85% of stocks)
✓ Stock up >10% while SPY up 0-3% (relative outperformance)

3-Month RS:
✓ RS rating >80
✓ Stock making new highs while market below old highs (divergence)

6-Month RS:
✓ RS line trending up (not just 1-month spike)
✓ Consistently outperforming market over time

Sector RS:
✓ Stock outperforming its sector ETF
✓ Top 3-5 in its sector by RS rating

How I verify RS:
- TradingView: RS line indicator (stock / SPY)
- Finviz screener: RS rating column (sorted descending)
- MarketSmith: RS rating (industry standard)

MY RULE:
"RS rating >85 is mandatory for new positions.
If RS drops below 70, I reduce position size by 50%.
If RS drops below 50, I exit position (relative weakness signal)."

---

S - SETUP (Actionable Entry Pattern)

Clear, low-risk setup must be present:

Setup Type #1: Base Breakout
✓ 20-40 day consolidation below resistance
✓ Volume contracted in base, expands on breakout
✓ Tight range (3-5% depth preferred)
✓ Clean pivot point visible

Setup Type #2: Pullback to 21 EMA
✓ Stock in uptrend (above 50 SMA)
✓ Pulls back 5-10% to rising 21 EMA
✓ Volume low during pullback (constructive)
✓ Bounces off 21 EMA with volume expansion

Setup Type #3: Flag/Consolidation
✓ After 15-20% move, tightens 3-5 days
✓ Small range consolidation (3-5%)
✓ Breaks out on volume

MY RULE:
"Setup quality is non-negotiable. Even if stock has perfect T.I.G.E.R
scoring on other criteria, without clean setup I PASS.
Entry timing matters as much as stock selection."

---

T.I.G.E.R.S SCORING SYSTEM

For each stock, score 0-2 on each criterion:

T - Theme: 
  0 = Not in leading theme
  1 = In secondary theme
  2 = In primary theme (AI, semis, cybersecurity)

I - Innovation:
  0 = Commodity/no moat
  1 = Some differentiation
  2 = Clear, defensible innovation

G - Growth:
  0 = <20% EPS growth
  1 = 20-40% EPS growth
  2 = >40% EPS growth (or accelerating)

E - Edges:
  0 = 0-1 edges
  1 = 2 edges
  2 = 3+ edges

R - Relative Strength:
  0 = RS <70
  1 = RS 70-85
  2 = RS >85

S - Setup:
  0 = No setup / extended
  1 = Forming setup (not ready)
  2 = Clean setup ready to trigger

TOTAL SCORE: __/12

Position Sizing Based on Score:
- 10-12: Full size (10-20% depending on environment)
- 8-9: Standard size (8-10%)
- 6-7: Starter size (5%)
- <6: Pass

EXAMPLE SCORING:

NVIDIA (NVDA) - December 2024
T: 2 (AI semiconductors, primary theme)
I: 2 (GPU dominance, CUDA ecosystem)
G: 2 (150% YoY EPS growth)
E: 2 (RS 98, HV, clean bases, multi-TF)
R: 2 (RS 98, outperforming all peers)
S: 2 (Base breakout at $138)
TOTAL: 12/12 ✓✓✓ APPROVED - Maximum sizing

Random Mid-Cap Software
T: 1 (Cloud/SaaS, secondary theme)
I: 1 (Some differentiation but competitive)
G: 1 (25% EPS growth, OK not great)
E: 1 (RS 82, volume OK, 2 edges)
R: 1 (RS 82, good not great)
S: 1 (Setup forming but not ready)
TOTAL: 6/12 → Pass or very small starter

MY RULE:
"I score every stock on T.I.G.E.R.S before adding to watchlist.
Stocks scoring <6 don't make Universe List.
Stocks scoring 10+ make Leadership List."
```

- Leadership List stocks (if set up) = priority
- Best setups from Universe List
- 2-3 per leading theme
- Mix of setup types (breakouts, pullbacks, flags)

Size: 8-12 stocks (flexible based on market conditions)

What I define for each stock on Weekly List:

- Notes (why this stock, what to watch)

Example Weekly List Entry:
```
NVDA - AI/Semiconductors
Setup: Base breakout
Entry trigger: $139.50 (break above 20-day range)
Stop: $136.50 (below breakout day low)
Risk: $3.00 = 2.15%
Target: $153+ (10% minimum, let run if Environment A)
Position size: 15% (Environment A, T.I.G.E.R.S 12/12)
Notes: AI chip demand strong, data center revenue accelerating,
       multiple semis working (SMCI, AMD confirming theme)
```

MY RULE:
"Weekly List stocks are my A+ ideas for the week.
I only trade from Weekly List - no random impulse trades.
If I see a trade opportunity not on Weekly List, I add it first, 
analyze it, then decide. No shortcuts."

---

LEVEL 4: DAILY FOCUS LIST (~4 stocks)

Purpose: Battle plan for tomorrow - stocks most likely to trigger

Update frequency: Daily after market close (4-5 PM SGT = post-US market)

Selection criteria:
✓ From Weekly List only

  "IF NVDA breaks $139.50 on >20M volume by 10:30 AM EST,
   BUY at $139.60, place stop at $136.50, position size 15%"
- Contingency plan:
  "IF fails to break out, remove from Daily Focus List"
  "IF gaps above trigger, wait for pullback or pass"

Example Daily Focus List (for tomorrow):
```
1. NVDA - Breakout watch $139.50
   Entry: $139.60 (if breaks on volume)
   Stop: $136.50
   Size: 15%

## PART 5: YOUR COMPLETE DAILY ROUTINE

### Preparing, Executing, and Learning Every Trading Day

**Time Commitment:** 1-1.5 hours total
- Pre-market: 30 minutes (before US market open)
- During market: 5-10 minutes actively (+ passive monitoring)
- Post-market: 20 minutes (after US market close)

**Note on Timing (Singapore to US Market):**
- US Market Open: 9:30 AM EST = 10:30 PM SGT
- US Market Close: 4:00 PM EST = 5:00 AM SGT (next day)

**Your Schedule Adaptation:**
Since US market runs late evening/overnight in Singapore, you have two options:

**Option A: Trade US Evening Open** (Recommended for your schedule)
- Pre-market routine: 9:00-9:30 PM SGT (before 10:30 PM open)
- Monitor first 30-60 min: 10:30-11:30 PM SGT
- Set orders and alerts, then sleep
- Post-market routine: Next evening 7-8 PM SGT (review previous day)

**Option B: Review Morning Results**
- Wake up, check overnight results (7-8 AM SGT)
- Manage positions if needed
- Set new orders for upcoming evening session
- Post-market routine: 7-8 PM SGT same day

**Below is Option A (Trading Evening Open) - Most realistic for full-time employed:**

```
DAILY ROUTINE: TRADING DAYS

===========================================
PRE-MARKET ROUTINE (9:00-9:30 PM SGT = 30 minutes)
===========================================

Time: 9:00-9:30 PM SGT (before 10:30 PM US market open)

STEP 1: OVERNIGHT REVIEW (10 minutes)
Time: 9:00-9:10 PM

[ ] Check overnight action (if any news after 5 AM SGT)
    - Open TradingView or broker
    - Check: Did any major news break during US daytime?
    - Check futures: SPY/QQQ futures up or down? ___%
    
[ ] Check current holdings (if any):
    - For each position:
      * Current P&L: +/- ___%
      * Still above 21 EMA? Y/N
      * Stop still intact? Y/N
      * Action needed tonight: Hold / Trim / Exit / Adjust
    
[ ] Review major news/catalysts:
    - Earnings reports after close yesterday?
    - Any Fed announcements today?
    - Any major tech news (AI, chips, cybersecurity)?
    - Expected volatility today: Low / Medium / High

[ ] Identify today's market type:
    Based on futures, news, and recent trend:
    - OFFENSE day? (strong market, leaders strong → increase exposure)
    - NEUTRAL day? (mixed signals → be selective)
    - DEFENSE day? (weak market, leaders weak → raise cash, tighten stops)
    
    My bias for today: ____________________

STEP 2: DAILY FOCUS LIST REVIEW (15 minutes)
Time: 9:10-9:25 PM

[ ] Open yesterday's Daily Focus List (from post-market routine)
    
[ ] For each stock on Daily Focus List (2-4 stocks):
    
    Stock 1: ___________
    [ ] Review chart (daily + intraday if needed)

    [ ] Entry trigger: $_____ (exact price)
    [ ] Entry conditions:
        - Price breaks $_____
        - Volume >_____M shares (50-100% above average)
        - Close in top half of day's range
    [ ] Stop loss: $_____ (exact price, pre-calculated)
    [ ] Position size: ___% (from Weekly List plan)
    [ ] Risk per position: Entry - Stop = $_____ = ___%
    [ ] Target profit: $_____ (initial +10%, then let run if strong)
    
    Repeat for stocks 2, 3, 4...

[ ] Set alerts on broker/TradingView:
    - Entry level alert (price)
    - Stop loss alert
    - Profit target alert (+10% from entry)

[ ] Write today's trade plan (1-2 sentences per stock):
    Example:
    "NVDA: IF breaks $139.50 on >20M volume before 11 PM SGT,
     BUY at $139.60, place stop $136.50, size 15% of portfolio.
     Target $153 (+10%), let run if Environment A and strong action."
     
    "CRWD: IF pulls back to $420 and bounces with volume,
     BUY at $420-422, stop $410, size 10%.
     Only if market showing strength, skip if weak open."

---

STEP 3: MENTAL PREPARATION (5 minutes)
Time: 9:25-9:30 PM

    - Max position size tonight: ___%

     - Only trade from Daily Focus List (no random ideas)
     - Execute ONLY if exact criteria met (price + volume)
     - Place stops immediately on every entry
     - Stick to planned position sizes
     - Not chase if stock gaps past my entry"

[ ] Mental reset:
    - Take 3 deep breaths
    - Clear mind of non-trading thoughts
    - "I have a plan. I will execute the plan. No emotions."

PRE-MARKET ROUTINE COMPLETE (9:30 PM SGT)
US Market opens in 1 hour (10:30 PM SGT)

===========================================
DURING MARKET HOURS (10:30 PM - 12:00 AM SGT)
===========================================

Goal: Monitor first 30-90 minutes, execute plan, then set orders for overnight

STEP 1: OPENING RANGE (10:30-11:00 PM SGT = 30 min)

[ ] Watch QQQ first 10 minutes:
    - Opens up or down? ___%

    - Market tone: Strong / Weak / Mixed

[ ] Watch Daily Focus List stocks:
    - Are they moving as expected?
    - Any breaking out on entry trigger?
    - Any gapping past entry (decision: chase or pass)?

[ ] Execute entries IF criteria met:
    - ONLY if exact trigger price hit

[ ] Check existing holdings:

    - Any need to tighten stops? (if cushion >10%)

[ ] Monitor Daily Focus List:
    - Any setups triggered late? (execute if valid)
    - Any setups failed? (remove from list)

[ ] Decision point at 12:00 AM SGT:
    - Set all stops/profit targets as limit orders
    - If no trades triggered, go to sleep
    - Wake up 7 AM SGT to check overnight results

OPTION: IF YOU CAN'T MONITOR LIVE (Automated Approach)

    - Entry order: "Buy ___ shares at $_____ limit"
    - Stop loss: "Stop loss sell at $_____"
