  Standard (2.0-2.5x): Normal volatility
  Wide (2.5-3.0x): Higher volatility
  Very Wide (3.0-4.0x): Extreme volatility (reduce size!)

Method 2: Technical Stop
  Setup low - $0.50
  Below 21 EMA - 1% of price
  Below 50 SMA - 2% of price
  Below swing low - $0.25-0.50

  Env A: 2.5% max total heat
  Env B: 2.0% max
  Env C: 1.0% max

✅ Do: Journal every single trade (5 min each)

PITFALL #7: Revenge Trading
❌ Don't: Try to make back losses immediately
✅ Do: Follow circuit breakers (3 losses = stop)

PITFALL #8: Comparing to Paper
❌ Don't: Expect exact same results as paper
✅ Do: Expect 10-20% worse initially (emotional tax)
