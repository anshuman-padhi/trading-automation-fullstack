```

### Stage 2: +20% Gain  
```
ACTION: Sell another 33% (1/3 of original)
STOP:   Lock to entry + 10% profit on final 33%
RESULT: 6.6% cumulative locked, core position protected
```

### Stage 3: Runner Position
```
ACTION: Trail final 33% with stop
METHOD: 21 EMA trail OR ATR trail OR Fixed % trail
EXIT:   Close below stop or weakness signal
RESULT: Maximize final move, protected by trailing stop
```

## WEAKNESS SIGNALS (Exit Immediately)

| Signal | Definition | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **21 EMA Break** | Close below 21 EMA + volume | EXIT immediately |
| **50 SMA Break** | Close below 50 SMA | TIGHTEN STOP |
| **Lower High** | New high < prior high | TIGHTEN STOP |
| **Failed Bounce** | Gap recover on weak volume | TIGHTEN STOP |
| **Volume Dying** | Rising on declining volume | EXIT (momentum failing) |
| **Earnings Soon** | <1 week to earnings | EXIT 50-100% |

---

## TIME-BASED EXITS

```
10 Days Flat:      No progress → EXIT (capital not working)
20 Days No Highs:  Price hasn't hit entry + 10% → EXIT
30 Days Held:      Swing trade time limit → EXIT (redeploy)
```

---

## TRAILING STOP METHODS

### Method 1: 21 EMA Trail (Conservative)
```
Stop = 21 EMA (daily) - (1% of current price)
Adjust: Daily
Exit: Close below 21 EMA
Best for: Strong trends, momentum plays
```

### Method 2: ATR Trail (Dynamic)
```
Stop = Current Price - (ATR × 2.5-3.0x)
Adjust: Daily (stops widens if volatility up)
Exit: Close below ATR trailing stop
Best for: Adapting to volatility changes
```

### Method 3: Fixed Profit Trail (Simple)
```
+0-10%:   Stop at breakeven
+10-20%:  Stop at entry + 5% profit
+20-30%:  Stop at entry + 10% profit
+30-40%:  Stop at entry + 15% profit
+40%+:    Stop at entry + 20-30% profit
```

## EARNINGS MANAGEMENT

### 1-2 Weeks Before
```
Normal trading, full position
```

```

```

### 3 Days Before
```
Check Implied Move %
  If <4%: Can hold 50%
  If >6%: Too risky, EXIT ALL
```

```

✓ At Stage 1, 2, 3 targets
✓ On weakness signals
✓ Before earnings events
✓ When time stops trigger

DON'T DO THIS:
✗ Never add to losing positions
✗ Never hold through earnings unprepared
✗ Never ignore 21 EMA break
✗ Never let winner turn loser
✗ Never hope for recovery
```

---

## QUICK DECISION TREE

```

Is it -5% or worse?
  YES → Check stop, likely at stop loss
  NO  → Continue

Any weakness signal?
  YES → EXIT immediately
  NO  → Continue

Is it +10% or more?
  YES → Stage 1: Take 1/3 off table
  NO  → Continue holding

Is it +20% or more?
  YES → Stage 2: Take another 1/3 off
  NO  → Continue holding

```

## CALCULATION EXAMPLES

### Stage 1 Calculation
```
Entry: $350, Position: 15 shares
At +10% gain = $385

Stage 1: Sell 1/3 = 5 shares at $385
Profit: 5 × $35 = $175
Remaining: 10 shares at breakeven stop $350
```

### Stage 2 Calculation
```
From 10 remaining shares, stock at $420 (+20%)

Stage 2: Sell 1/3 of original = 5 shares at $420
Profit: 5 × $70 = $350
Move stop: Entry + 10% = $385 on final 5 shares
Total profit locked: $175 + $350 = $525
```

### Trailing Stop Example
```
Entry: $350, Current: $455 (+30%)
ATR: $10, Multiplier: 2.5x

Stop = $455 - ($10 × 2.5) = $455 - $25 = $430

If stock continues:
  At $480: Stop = $480 - $25 = $455
  At $500: Stop = $500 - $25 = $475
  
If pull back to $470: $470 > $455 ✓ Stay in
If pull back to $430: $430 = $430 ✗ Stop hit, EXIT
```

## SPECIFIC RULES TO REMEMBER

### The Golden Rule
```
SELL WEAKNESS, BUY STRENGTH
Take profits on strength, exit on weakness
```

### The 21 EMA Rule
```
Close below 21 EMA on volume = AUTOMATIC SELL
This is the most reliable momentum reversal signal
Never ignore it
```

### The Earnings Rule
```
Never hold through earnings without a plan
1 week before: Exit 50% minimum
3 days before: Exit all remaining
```

### The Time Rule
```
10 days flat → EXIT
20 days no progress → EXIT
30 days held → EXIT
Capital that's not growing = opportunity cost
Redeploy it elsewhere
```

### The Greed Rule
```
At +30% gain = Start thinking about exit
At +50% gain = Be prepared to exit anytime
At +100% gain = Seriously trail stops tightly
Don't give back huge gains looking for more
```
