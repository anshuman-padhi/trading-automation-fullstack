```
IDEA SCORE (Was the setup good?):
  [ ] Setup Grade A/B? → Good idea
  [ ] 4+ edges present? → Good idea
  [ ] Pattern developed as expected? → Good idea
  [ ] Stock continued higher after exit? → Good idea
  
  VERDICT: A (excellent) / B (good) / C (marginal) / F (poor)

EXECUTION SCORE (Did YOU follow rules?):
  [ ] Entered exactly per rules? → Good execution
  [ ] Stop placed correctly (ATR)? → Good execution
  [ ] Sized correctly (0.5% risk)? → Good execution
  [ ] Took Stage 1 & 2 profits? → Good execution
  [ ] Exited on weakness signals? → Good execution
  
  VERDICT: A (perfect) / B (good) / C (poor) / F (terrible)
```

### 2×2 Matrix (Plot Every Trade)
```
         EXECUTION
          A/B  C/F
          ───  ───
IDEA  A/B │✓✓ │✓✗│ Keep doing this | Improve execution
      ───  ├───┼───┤
      C/F  │✗✓ │✗✗│ Raise bar | Don't repeat
          └───┴───┘

✓✓ = Good idea + Good execution (WINNERS - do 80% of trades here)
✓✗ = Good idea + Poor execution (Improve discipline, don't change setup)
✗✓ = Poor idea + Good execution (Raise setup standards, filter more)
✗✗ = Poor idea + Poor execution (Don't repeat)

## METRIC FORMULAS (Copy to Spreadsheet)

```
Win Rate = (Wins / Total Trades) × 100

Profit Factor = Total Profit / Total Loss

Average Win = Total Profit / Number of Wins

Average Loss = Total Loss / Number of Losses

Win/Loss Ratio = Average Win / Average Loss

Expectancy = (Win Rate × Avg Win) - (Loss Rate × Avg Loss)

Monthly Return = (End Value - Start Value) / Start Value × 100

Max Drawdown = (Peak - Trough) / Peak × 100

Sharpe Ratio = (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation
```
