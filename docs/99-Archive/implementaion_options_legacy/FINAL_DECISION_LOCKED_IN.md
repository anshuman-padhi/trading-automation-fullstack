## STRATEGIC COMMITMENT: Hybrid Path B → Path C
**Date:** January 1, 2026
**Status:** **LOCKED & CONFIRMED**

---

## 1. THE MISSION
Build a professional-grade, automated trading system that generates consistent profits while minimizing development risk and time-to-market.

## 2. THE CHOSEN STRATEGY
**HYBRID APPROACH (Path B → C)**
*   **Development:** Local MacBook Pro (Python)
*   **Initial Production (Phase 1):** AWS Lambda + S3 (Serverless)
*   **Final Production (Phase 3):** Full Stack (FastAPI + React + Postgres)

### Why This Wins:
1.  **Speed:** We start trading in Week 5 (Validation Phase), not Week 20.
2.  **Cost:** We pay pennies (<$5/mo) while proving the concept.
3.  **Safety:** We validate the *trading logic* before building complex *infrastructure*.
4.  **Scalability:** The final system (Path C) is enterprise-ready.

## 6. FINAL DECLARATION

I, **[Use Your Name]**, commit to the **20-Week Hybrid Roadmap**.

I understand that:
1.  **Consistency is key.** small progress every day > bursts of effort.
2.  **Validation comes first.** I will not build the fancy dashboard until the trading logic is proven.
3.  **Risk is managed.** I will follow the Position Sizing and Contingency rules strictly.

**DECISION IS LOCKED.**
**NO MORE PLANNING.**
**ONLY EXECUTION.**

**START DATE:** Tomorrow Morning, 08:00 AM.
**TARGET LIVE DATE:** Week 21.
